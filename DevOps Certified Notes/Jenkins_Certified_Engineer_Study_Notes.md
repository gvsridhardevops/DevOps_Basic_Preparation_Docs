## Key CI/CD/Jenkins Concepts

### Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration Concepts

- Define continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment
    - [Continuous Integration](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
      > Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day.
    - [Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html)
      > Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.
    - Continuous Deployment
      > Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention.
- [Difference between CI and CD](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/ci-vs-ci-vs-cd)
  > **CI**- The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build.
  >
  > **CD**- An extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. 
- [Stages of CI and CD](https://www.michielrook.nl/2018/01/typical-ci-cd-pipeline-explained/)
    - **CI**
        - Code checkout
        - Code analysis, linting
        - Compile
        - Unit test
        - Integration test
        - Package artifacts
        - Publish artifacts
    - **CD**
        - Provision environments
        - Deploy artifacts to environments
        - Performing tests
            - Automated UI test
            - Performance and load test
            - Smoke test
            - Acceptance test
        - Manual release to production (Optional, for Continuous Delivery)
        - Monitoring and telemetry
- [Continuous delivery versus continuous deployment](https://puppet.com/blog/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-what-s-diff)
  > **Continuous delivery**- a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time. Every change is delivered to a staging environment using complete automation. It can be deployed to production with a push of a button when the business is ready.
  >
  > **Continuous deployment**- the next step of continuous delivery: Every change that passes the automated tests is deployed to production automatically.

### Jobs

- What are jobs in Jenkins?
  > [**Jobs** are actually **projects** in Jenkins now.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17902242/difference-between-jenkins-job-and-project)
- Types of jobs
    - Freestyle
    - Maven
    - Pipline
    - Multi-configuration
    - Multibranch pipeline
    - External job
- Scope of jobs (**Can't find this item**)

### Builds

- [What are builds in Jenkins?](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project)
- What are build steps, triggers, artifacts, and repositories?
    - **Build steps** are the basic building blocks for the Jenkins freestyle build process. They are what let you tell Jenkins exactly how you want your project built
    - **Triggers** are how you tell Jenkins when to kick off a build
    - **Artifacts** are files which are associated with a single build. Artifacts can be used to represent data created as a side-effect of running a Jenkins build.
- Build tools configuration
    - [YouTube- Jenkins using global tools configuration & java_ant_git_tutorial_job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE-tG8ccHK8)

### Source Code Management

- What are source code management systems and how are they used?
    - [Wikipedia- Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
- Cloud based SCMs
  > GitHub, Bitbuckte, AWS CodeCommit, and etc.
- Incremental updates vs. clean check out
  > **Incremental build**: if it doesn't think it needs to rebuild a project, it won't. It may also use partially-built bits of the project if they haven't changed
  >
  > **Clean solution** will remove the build artifacts from the previous build
- Checking in code
  > To **check in** (ci or, [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(revision_control))) is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. The terms 'commit' and 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.
- Infrastructure-as-Code
  > **[Infrastructure as code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)** is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools
- Branch and Merge Strategies
  > [ABCs of a Branching and Merging Strategy](https://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/abcs-branching-and-merging-strategy) is a good article. The most commonly used strategies are [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) and [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

### Testing

- Benefits of testing with Jenkins
  > Test Automation software is the best way to increase the effectiveness, efficiency and coverage of your software testing. ... Once automated tests are created they can easily be repeated and they can be extended to perform tasks impossible with manual testing (see also [Top 10 Benefits of Automated Testing](https://saucelabs.com/blog/top-10-benefits-of-automated-testing))
- Define unit test, smoke test, acceptance test, automated verification/functional tests
  > **Unit test**- a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing))
  >
  > **Smoke test** is preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to, for example, reject a prospective software release. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)))
  >
  > **Acceptance test**- a formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system. ([Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing))
  >
  > **Functional test** is a quality assurance (QA) process and a type of black-box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing))

### Notifications

- Types of notifications in Jenkins
  > Email, RSS, IM (IRC, Slack, and etc.), HTTP call
- Importance of notifications
  > Better visibility, more transparent, faster feedback loop, continuous improvement, and etc.

### [Distributed Builds](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds)

- What are distributed builds?
  > The reason being that workloads are often best "farmed out" to distributed servers. This may be for scale, or to provide different tools, or build on different target platforms. Another common reason for remote agents is to enact deployments into secured environments (without the master having direct access).
- Functions of masters and agents
  > A "**master**" operating by itself is the basic installation of Jenkins and in this configuration the master handles all tasks for your build system.
  > 
  > An **agent** is a computer that is set up to offload build projects from the master and once setup this distribution of tasks is fairly automatic. 

### [Plugins](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/)

- What are plugins?
  > Jenkins defines extensibility points, which are interfaces or abstract classes that model an aspect of a build system. Those interfaces define contracts of what need to be implemented, and Jenkins allows plugins to contribute those implementations.
- What is the plugin manager?
  > The Web UI to manage Jenkins plugins.

### [Jenkins Rest API](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API)

- How to interact with it
  > BASH (curl), PowerShell (Invoke-WebRrequest or Invoke-RestMethod), web client, etc.
- Why use it?
  > Interact with Jenkins programmatically


### Security

- [Authentication versus authorization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6556522/authentication-versus-authorization)
- [Matrix security](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Matrix-based+security)
- Definition of auditing, credentials, and other key security concepts
  > An **IT audit** is the examination and evaluation of an organization's information technology infrastructure, policies and operations. Information technology audits determine whether IT controls protect corporate assets, ensure data integrity and are aligned with the business's overall goals.
  > 
  > **Credentials** refer to the verification of identity or tools for authentication. They may be part of a certificate or other authentication process that helps confirm a user’s identity in relation to a network address or other system ID.
  > [Other key security concepts from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Key_concepts)

### Fingerprints

- What are [fingerprints](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Fingerprint)?
  > Jenkins supports file fingerprinting to track interdependencies of artifacts in different projects.
- How do fingerprints work?
  > The fingerprint of a file is simply a MD5 checksum. Jenkins maintains a database of md5sum, and for each md5sum, Jenkins records which builds of which projects used. This database is updated every time a build runs and files are fingerprinted.

### Artifacts

- How to use artifacts in Jenkins
  > 1. Archive artifacts in upstream projects: In the Jenkins project (or job) configuration, create a **Post Build Action**, select **Archive the artifacts**, also in **General** section, set the **Permission to Copy Artifact**
  > 2. Use the archived artifacts in downstream projects: In the Jenkins project (or job) configuration, create a **Build step**, select **Copy artifacts from another project**
- Storing artifacts
  > It is being archived on the master server (even if the build were on a slave) in the following folder:
  >
  > `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<job>/builds/<build>/archive`
  >
  > But you can configure a different location using the 'Advanced' setting of the job (where you can set a different workspace folder) or using plugins that are made for this purpose such as Copy Artifact Plugin ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35890952/where-are-jenkins-artifacts-located))

### Using 3rd party tools

- How to use 3rd party tools
  > Not very sure what is the scope of 3rd party tools. A lot of plugins provide integration with 3rd party tools. Also 3rd party tools can use Jenkins Rest API or Jenkins CLI to work with Jenkins.

### Installation Wizard

- What is the Jenkins Installation Wizard?
  > It is the [post-installation setup wizard](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#setup-wizard). It takes you through are a few quick "one-off" steps to unlock Jenkins, customize it with plugins and create the first administrator user through which you can continue accessing Jenkins.
- How to use the Wizard?
- Which configurations are covered by the Installation Wizard?
  > Unlock Jenkins by providing the Administrator password. Customizing Jenkins with plugins. Creating the first administrator user

## Jenkins usage (features and functionality)

### Jobs

- Organizing jobs in Jenkins
  > **[Views](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/organizing-jobs-views-instead-folders-just-my-grandma)** (my view or custom view) and **folders** are the ways to organize projects
- Parameterized jobs
  > Use **[parameterized build](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Build)**, The parameters are available as environment variables.
  > The **[Parameterized Trigger Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin)** lets you trigger new builds when your build has completed, with various ways of specifying parameters for the new build.
- Usage of Freestyle/Pipeline/Matrix jobs
    > Matrix jobs are [**Multi-configuration projects**](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+matrix+project) now.
    >
    > **Freestyle** projects are good start point and can be treated as an empty template.
    > [**Pipeline**](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) in Jenkins is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code" via the Pipeline DSL.

### Builds

- Setting up build steps and triggers
  > In **freestyle** projects, build steps are defined in configuration (build section). In **pipeline** projects, build steps are defined by Pipeline DSL.
  >
  > Build [**triggers**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47758526) are defined in the project configuration (**Build Triggers** section). The triggers can be another upstream project, a schedule, a SCM hook, polling SCM changes, or an API call.
- Configuring build tools
  > You can configure build tools in **Manage Jenkins, Global Tools Configuration**.
  > 
  > There are sections for **Maven**, **JDK**, **Git**, **Gradle**, **Ant**, **Docker**, and etc.
- Running scripts as part of build steps
  > In **freestyle** projects, you can select running scripts as a build step.
  >
  > In **pipeline** projects, you can run scripts via the **`sh`** directive.

### Source Code Management

- Polling source code management
  > The schedule of polling SCM can be defined with [cron job syntax](http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference) (with minor difference) with additional time zone specificcation)
- Creating hooks
  > There is [a great tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks) from Atlassian, the maker of Bitbucket, on Git hooks.
- Including version control tags and version information
  > [_How do you achieve a numeric versioning scheme with Git_](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/141973/how-do-you-achieve-a-numeric-versioning-scheme-with-git) from Stack Overflow

### Testing

- Testing for code coverage
  > For Java projects, [Cobertura plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin) is a tool to [generate code coverage reports](https://jenkins-le-guide-complet.github.io/html/sect-first-steps-metrics.html)
- Test reports in Jenkins
  > For Maven projects, there is no extra configuration required. For Java projects, user needs to add the **Publish JUnit test result report** as a **Post-build Actions**. For projects in other languages, similar configuration is required after adding **xUnit plugin**.
- Displaying test results
  > Jenkins displays test result after getting the test reports. The result includes trend, test list, test details, and time costs. (from book [Jenkins: The Definitive Guide](http://www.bogotobogo.com/DevOps/Jenkins/images/Intro_install/jenkins-the-definitive-guide.pdf))
- Integrating with test automation tools
- Breaking builds

### Notifications

- Setup and usage
  > There are different notification strategies, and different notification channels.
  >
  > A good aproach is to notify the one who caused build failure first, then notify others when the failure repeats.
  > The notification channels include **email**, **editable email**, **RSS feed**, **instant messaging**, **SMS**, **desktop notification**, **noisy sound**, and some **special devices**
- Email notifications, instant messaging
  > There are regular email notification and (advanced) editable email notification.
  >
  > The instant messaging notifications include Jabber, IRC, Slack, Trello, and etc.
- Alarming on notifications
  > Use plugins to make noisy sound alarm?

### Distributed Builds

- Setting up and running builds in parallel
- Setting up and using SSH agents, JNLP agents, cloud agents
  > To use **SSH agents**, put master's ssh public key in slave's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` directory. To use **JNLP agents**, initial the connection request from slave. There are several plugins for **cloud agents**, such as for AWS, GCP, or OpenStack
- Monitoring nodes
  > You can check the status of nodes in **Configure Jenkins** -> **Configure nodes**. You can also set the **retention strategy** for nodes

### Plugins

- Setting up and using Plugin Manager
  > [_**Managing Plugins**_](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/) page addresses Jenkins Plugin Manager
- Finding and configuring required plugins
  > From Plugin Manager's **available** tab, upload an **`.hpi`** from **advanced** tab, or [using the **Jenkins CLI**](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/#install-with-cli)

# jenkins cheatsheet

## project configuration for git and docker  

- `docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins`  
  
    > _we download and run jenkins in docker_  
  
    _after initialization a long password is printed_  
    _login on localhost:8080 using this password_  
  
- install suggested plugins  
  
- select new item & freestyle project  
    
    - source code management  
    _we can match the jenkins item with a repo_  
    _and easily manage our source code_  
  
    - build  
    _we can add a build step here_  
    _for example we can build the image from Dockerfile and run it:_  
        - execute shell  
            `docker build -t dummy-project .`  
            `docker run -tid -p 5000:8080 dummy-project`  


## pipeline for git and docker  

- new pipeline  

- pipeline script:  
_here we can configure the build step by step_  
_stage simply indicates a higher level sequence than steps_  
_stages shown as columns in pipeline stage view with time and status_  

    _for 1st stage, we can use git checkout command_  
    _instead of removing folder and cloning it again_  
  
```
pipeline {
    agent { label 'master' }  
    stages {  
        stage('git clone') {  
            steps {  
                sh """
                    rm -rf dummy-project;
                    git clone https://gitlab.com/celikeren/dummy-project.git
                """
            }  
        }  
        stage('build') {  
            steps {  
                sh """
                    docker build -t erencelik/dummy-project 
                        /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/dummy-project
                """
            }  
        }  
        stage('run') {  
            steps {  
                sh 'docker run -tid -p 5000:8080 erencelik/dummy-project'  
            }  
        }  
        stage('push') {  
            steps {  
                sh 'docker push erencelik/dummy-project'  
            }  
        }  
    }  
}  
```

  _here we cloned the git repo, built a docker image,_  
  _ran it as a container and pushed it to docker hub._  
    
   __you don't need to do the same things in every deploy__  
   __just tell jenkins once and it handles the rest__  


## Jenkinsfile  

_a step further_  
_we can make it easier with a Jenkinsfile in the project_  


```
String gitOrigin = "https://gitlab.com/celikeren/dummy-project.git"
String dockerHub = "erencelik/dummy-project"
node{
properties([
    parameters([
        gitParameter(branch: '',
                     defaultValue: '1.0',
                     description: '',
                     useRepository: "${gitOrigin}",
                     name: 'tag',
                     quickFilterEnabled: false,
                     selectedValue: 'NONE',
                     sortMode: 'NONE',
                     tagFilter: '*',
                     branchFilter: 'origin/(.*)',
                     type: 'PT_TAG')
    ])
])
   stage ('Checkout') {
   checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: 'tags/${tag}']], 
   doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false,gitTool: 'Default', extensions: [], 
   submoduleCfg: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: 
   '162a1630-56da-4614-82c1-7f07dc0d8751', url: "${gitOrigin}"]]]) 
  }
 
    stage("Build Dockerfile"){
         sh """
         docker build -t ${dockerHub}:${tag} .
         """
    }
    stage("Push Docker Image"){
           sh """
           docker push ${dockerHub}:${tag} 
          """
    }
    
}
```
